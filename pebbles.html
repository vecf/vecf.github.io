				<h1 id="description">Introduction</h1>

				<p>This page is a run through of my <a
				href="./media/masters/thesis.pdf">master’s thesis</a> from which <a
				href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11370-021-00350-1">this publication</a>
				is derived and deals with coordinating multiple robots in online
				order fulfilment systems.</p>

				<h1 id="visiting-pebbles-on-rectangular-grids---the-ideas">Visiting Pebbles on Rectangular Grids - The Ideas
				</h1>

				<p>The name was inspired by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1984.715921">Kornhauser et al</a>’s work
					entitled <em>Coordinating Pebble Motion On Graphs</em> (PMOG). <strong>Abstractly</strong>, pebbles
					represent agents requiring access to shared resources represented by <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">Graph</a> nodes.
					Specifically, only one pebble can access a node at a time. The goal of PMOG is to determine whether a
					target configuration is reachable from the initial arrangement of pebbles and provide the sequence of
					required moves in this case.</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-8 col-12-medium">

						<p><strong>Concretely</strong>, PMOG is applicable in robotic
						warehousing systems: the pebbles represent robots that access
						physical locations. This example is not as far fetched as it sounds:
						thousands of robots are delivering packages from storage to packing
						stations in warehouses every day and Kiva Systems is the company
						that pioneered their use. It’s also not new: Staples was the first
						company to go live with a Kiva system in 2006! A 2016 report
						estimated that Amazon was operating ~30k units and by 2022 <a
						href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/10-years-of-amazon-robotics-how-robots-help-sort-packages-move-product-and-improve-safety">
						Amazon reported</a> 520,000 world-wide. The next two images show the layout
						of a typical robotic distribution center and the robots they employ.
						Robots pick up and deliver shelves of inventory to pick/pack
						workers. See the <a
						href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/2908675.2908681">image
						source</a> for more information.  </p>

				<p>PMOG generalizes and solves a fundamental problem. However, the
				constraints could be relaxed for this application: robots only need to
				<strong>visit</strong> destination nodes, they don’t need to be in a
				pre-defined end configuration at the same time. <strong>Hence the
				‘visiting’ part of the title.</strong> This relaxation has implications
				for the feasibility check of the original PMOG: it’s easy to come up
				with feasible visiting PMOG cases that are infeasible in PMOG. Since
				warehouses are rectangular workspaces, my work is restricted to graphs
				made up of <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconnected_graph">bi-connected</a>
				rectangular grids. As long as there is at least one open node and the
				graph is bi-connected, every destination assignment is feasible in
				<strong>Visiting Pebble Motion on Rectangual Grids.</strong></p>

						<p>Let robots find their way using something like <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A*</a>, if
						another robot gets in the way, simply wait until the node is free
						again. Using the <a
						href="https://research.csc.ncsu.edu/alphabetsoup/">Alphabet Soup</a>
						multi-robot simulator, I modified the default behaviour to strictly
						adhere to the underlying navigation graph. Then, I only allowed
						robots to enter a node if it is empty. The next video shows what it
						looks like: the robots are pink, replenishing stations are blue,
						shelves are purple and packing stations are green. In this
						simulator, the shelves contain letters and the parcels being packed
						are words from a dictionary.</p>

				<p>There is a problem though: eventually the robots get stuck waiting

						<p>Simultaneous motion is achieved by assigning a priority to each
						robot and defining a round consisting of two phases. In a first
						phase, robots instruct each other to move along the swap path
						determined using BFS.  A robot sends instructions either to itself
						or the robot at the tip of the swap path. Robots send instructions
						to themselves in two scenarios: 1) to move to the next node, and 2)
						to remain in place while ordering others to move. This ensures that
						high priority robots decrease their distance from their target
						monotonically, which in turn ensures that progress is being made.
						Idle robots don’t send instructions, but receive them. At the end of
						this phase, each robot selects the highest priority instruction and
						forwards it as a node access request, maintaining the original
						sender’s priority.</p>
						
						<p>In the second phase, <strong>nodes</strong> select the highest
						priority request to notify successful requesters and these robots
						move. Then, all robots empty their instruction queues. This ends the
						round and the process repeats until all tasks are complete, at which
						point no one sends instructions and everything stops. In the next
						video, the same task assignments are used as before. Lower numbers
						mean higher priorities, making life hard for robot 10!</p>

					Synchronous Assumption</h1>

				<p>So far actions were synchronized into rounds and robots/nodes knew
				when transitions occur. However, the real world is asynchronous and
				these timings aren’t known beforehand. This could be fixed by
				synchronizing these moves into fixed time slices. However, unavoidable
				variances mean that some robots are faster than others making
				synchronization wasteful, and without a centralized synchronization
				signal, robots don’t know when the synchronization barriers occur so
				that they can replan or grant access.</p>
				
				<p>The answer to reducing this waste is to notify robots when their
				instructions have failed. Nodes notify all requesters when access is
				granted, and requesters react accordingly. Failed requests are relayed
				by the requesters to their originators. Instructed robots don’t know
				whether their instruction queues already contain the highest priority
				instruction they will get, so they immediately request what they have,
				and update accordingly when new requests arrive by
				withdrawing/resubmitting requests.</p>

						<p>Getting the details (available in my <a
						href="./media/masters/thesis.pdf">thesis</a>) right is
						<strong>really difficult</strong>.  Instead of slogging through
						that, let’s see it in action! In the next videos, robots indicate
						completion by highlighting themselves in red and indicate node
						visits by marking them with a purple circle. These robots have
						randomly initialized acceleration and speed limits to simulate
						real-world variances. The first video has tasks assigned in
						row-major order, however, any task assignment is allowed. In fact,
						robots can even all have the same target node as shown in the second
						video which is an example of an assignment that is infeasible in
						PMOG.</p>

						<p>So far only single tasks were assigned. Multiple tasks can be assigned by setting each robot’s priority
							equal to their task number. Even if one task is delayed by many others, as overriding tasks complete, the

							robots cyclically completing multiple random node visits without marking their destinations.</p>

				<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

				<p>The relaxations on PMOG allows robots to deliver payloads without
				collisions or deadlocks, in continuous asynchronous time and require
				comparatively little computation. The computation can also easily be
				distributed among multiple agents without requiring central
				coordination. These were the extents of my research scope and there is
				much room for improvement in terms of optimality. However, coordinating
				<em>n</em> robots with only one open spot to move is no mean feat and I
				am proud of what I achieved in this work.
