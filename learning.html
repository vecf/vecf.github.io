				<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
				<p>Coming to robotics from a mechanical engineering background, I found myself wanting to know more about
					computation, computer science and software engineering. The projects shown here summarize some of my
					self-learning experiences.</p>
				<h1 id="projects">Projects</h1>
				<h2 id="linux-from-scratch-lfs">Linux From Scratch (LFS)</h2>
				<p>In this project you download and compile all the separate pieces to assemble your own bootable Linux distro.
					No coding is done in this project, but you need to be able to follow instructions, know how to debug and know
					a bit about UNIX. I managed to finish the project and registered on their database <a
						href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/cgi-bin/lfscounter.php">here</a>. My LFS id is 28548.</p>
				<h2 id="modification">6502 modification</h2>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-10 col-12-medium">
						<p>The 6502 is praised for it’s simplicity and remembered for the impact it had on personal computing, so I
							decided to work though this tiny e-book I found called <a
								href="https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/">Easy 6502</a>. After reading the little book, I modified
							the snake game presented there to reinforce what I had learnt. The modifications make <code>snake</code>’s
							stomach contents visible. The code can be found on my GitHub <a
								href="https://github.com/vecf/urWu8Snake">here</a> and the video below shows a snippet of the gameplay.

				<h2 id="from-nand-to-tetris">From NAND to Tetris</h2>

						<p>After playing with 6502, I was confident enough to try <a
								href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">Nand2Tetris</a>. The subtitle “Building a Modern Computer From First
							Principles”, is actually just the first half of the course! In part 1, using only the <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate">NAND</a> gate and <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_%28electronics%29">DFF</a>’s, you build the chips to
							create the <code>Hack</code> computer: an educational (<a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_instruction_set_computer">MISC</a>) architecture. This is
							done in an educational hardware description language provided with pre-written tests to make development
							incremental. By the end of the course you write your own assembler for <code>Hack</code> in the
							programming language of your choice. I did it in <code>Python</code>.</p>
						<p>In part 2, you build a compiler targeting <code>Hack</code> for the <code>Jack</code> object-oriented
							programming language which the authors created: I stuck with <code>Python</code>. You also get to
							implement any project of your choice in the <code>Jack</code> language to learn how it works. Typically,
							students go for <code>Tetris</code>, hence the name. I re-implemented <code>snake</code>. In the final
							project, you implement the system calls provided by a bare-bones “operating system” in <code>Jack</code>.
						</p>

					<div class="col-8 col-12-medium">
				<p>The clip below shows the hardware emulator running my <code>snake</code> clone. When loading snake without
					the system binaries, the emulator offers to provide built-in versions. Then, when loading a version with snake
					and the system binaries, the emulator immediately loads the program.
					Instead of the direction keys I used <code>vi</code> keys because I was the target audience of the game. You
					set the speed and length of snake at the beginning of the game to help debug during development. I implemented
					playing the game at different sizes as a programming exercise, this is not demonstrated in the video.</p>

				<h2 id="mit-6.004---computational-structures">MIT 6.004 - Computational Structures</h2>
				<p>I worked through the worksheets and labs of the 2017 version of this <a
						href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-004-computation-structures-spring-2017/">MIT ocw course</a> together
					with its <a href="https://computationstructures.org">companion website</a>. Computational structures explores
					important topics that N2T skips: models of computation, cost/performance trade-offs, virtual memory, caching,
					memory hierarchy, interrupts, scheduling, pipelining and concurrency, compiler optimizations.</p>
				<p>There are three major challenges in this course, completed using instructor developed tools:</p>
				<ol type="1">
					<li>Programming a Turing machine to check if parentheses are balanced using the <code>TMSim</code> Turing
						machine simulator.</li>
					<li>Build a minimal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISC</a>
						processor called ‘Beta’ using the <code>Jade</code> circuit simulator.</li>
					<li>Modify a teaching operating system called <code>TinyOS</code> in the <code>BSIM</code> ‘Beta’ emulator.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The companion website implements all these tools using browser technologies. To see my answers to the labs in
					your browser:</p>
				<ol type="1">
					<li>Right-click and select ‘Save Link as …’ on my <a
							href="media/learning/saved_state_vecf.json">saved_state.json file</a></li>
					<li>Navigate <a href="https://computationstructures.org/exercises/fsm/lab.html">here</a>, scroll down and
						upload the file.<br />
					</li>
					<li>You can then browse to any of the labs and my answers should display.</li>

				<h3 id="parenthesis-checking-turing-machine">Parenthesis Checking Turing Machine</h3>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-8 col-12-medium">
						<p>The video below shows a Turing machine programmed to halt on a <code>1</code> if the parenthesis on the
							input tape are balanced and <code>0</code> if they are not. Doing it with only two states gets you full
							marks. This was the most challenging part of the <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">FSM</a> <a
								href="https://computationstructures.org/exercises/fsm/lab.html#">lab</a>. To see it in action, scroll
							down and click ‘Open <code>TMSim</code> in a new window’, click ‘TMSim assemble’ and then ‘Checkoff’.</p>

						<p>To do it in just two states, I developed the diagram shown below. The <em>f</em> <strong>state</strong>
							represents ‘found’ and <em>l</em> is for ‘looking’. The <em>o</em> <strong>symbol</strong> is for ‘open’
							and <em>s</em> is for ‘start’. Symbols <em>z</em> and <em>y</em> are arbitrarily named. The <em>l</em>
							<strong>motion</strong> means move the <strong>tape</strong> left, <em>r</em> is right and <em>-</em>
							means don’t move. This corresponds to the language of TMSim as seen in the video.</p>

					<div class="col-8 col-12-medium">
						<p>The final lab is <a href="https://computationstructures.org/exercises/dp/lab.html">Optimizing the
								Beta</a> that you built in the previous labs. Here a ‘Benmark’ of 20 is considered very doable and 40
							requires considerable insight and investment of time. Though not considered a course requirement, I tried
							to pipeline my design but failed. See the lab for more details. My final working design is tested in
							<code>/user/test_v7</code> and got a benchmark of 34.66. You can also inspect the <code>Beta</code> for
							this test looking at <code>/user/beta_6</code> and descending into its sub-components.</p>

				<h3 id="modify-tinyos">Modify TinyOS</h3>


						<p>The <a href="https://computationstructures.org/exercises/tinyos/lab.html">TinyOS lab</a> provides a
							minimal time-sharing OS written in <code>Beta</code> assembly. The provided code has two user processes:
							one periodically prints a counter value and the other takes user input and converts it to <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin">Pig Latin</a>. There are three design problems in this
							lab:</p>
						<ol type="1">
							<li>Initially, the Pig Latin translator doesn’t work. Once the kernel to user memory mapping is fixed,
								translations are printed at the console.</li>
							<li>Add a mouse device driver and print the coordinates of user clicks.</li>
							<li>Fix interleaving text at the console due to concurrent access by the user processes by implementing
								locking primitives.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>BSIM has a schematic view that shows the assembly code being executed on the hardware and an editor mode
							that follows along line by line as the program executes. The video below showcases these features.</p>
						<p>The next video shows the end result of the modifications done in the TinyOS lab.</p>

				<h2 id="ongoing-studies">Ongoing Studies</h2>
				<p>I also started studying operating systems with materials from <a
						href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2021/xv6.html">here</a>, <a
						href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/">here</a> and <a href="https://ops-class.org/">here</a>, and
					plan to continue when I have more time.</p>
				<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
				<p>I learnt a lot doing these projects and feel that I have a solid understanding of computation. It is not so
					much of mystery to me anymore how my code gets executed! I am confident that these lessons will help me to be
					a better software engineer.</p>
