# My Story

I've always loved figuring out how things work and combining them to solve
problems. This led me to study Mechanical Engineering at university. I
received a bursary from Transnet, a South African logistics company with
ports, pipelines and railways divisions, and worked in their R&D department
after graduation.  My interest in computation was sparked during my
part-time honours degree taking the *Optimum Design* and *Intelligent
Systems* courses. While at Transnet, I had the privilege of doing my
Master's degree in Japan. I wanted to cross over into robotics, so I chose
multi-agent coordination for my thesis topic. R&D had projects in various
areas including the ports, so after my return from Japan, my job became to
investigate the development of autonomous port vehicles. During this
process I discovered a passion for computer science and robotics.
