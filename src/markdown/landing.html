<p>Hi, I’m Francois. Welcome to my project portfolio! To learn about my professional experience, see my <a href="./media/resume.pdf">résumé</a>. You can also check out my <a href="https://github.com/vecf">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/francois-van-eeden-449a1395/">LinkedIn</a> profiles. Most importantly, don’t miss the <strong>Projects</strong> section below.</p>
<h1 id="my-story">My Story</h1>
<p>I’ve always loved figuring out how things work and combining them to solve problems. This led me to study Mechanical Engineering at university. I received a bursary from Transnet, a South African logistics company with ports, pipelines and railways divisions, and worked in their R&amp;D department after graduation. My interest in computation was sparked during my part-time honours degree taking the <em>Optimum Design</em> and <em>Intelligent Systems</em> courses. While at Transnet, I had the privilege of doing my Master’s degree in Japan. I wanted to cross over into robotics, so I chose multi-agent coordination for my thesis topic. R&amp;D had projects in various areas including the ports, so after my return from Japan, my job became to investigate the development of autonomous port vehicles. During this process I discovered a passion for computer science and robotics.</p>
