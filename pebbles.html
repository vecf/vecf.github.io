				<h1 id="description">Introduction</h1>
				<p>This article is a run through of my <a href="./media/masters/thesis.pdf">master’s thesis</a> from which <a
						href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11370-021-00350-1">this publication</a> is derived. This work deals with
					coordinating multiple robots in online order fulfilment systems.</p>
				<h1 id="visiting-pebbles-on-rectangular-grids---the-ideas">Visiting Pebbles on Rectangular Grids - The Ideas
				</h1>

				<p>The name was inspired by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1984.715921">Kornhauser et al</a>’s work
					entitled <em>Coordinating Pebble Motion On Graphs</em> (PMOG). <strong>Abstractly</strong>, pebbles
					represent agents requiring access to shared resources. <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">Graph</a> nodes represent the shared resources.
					Specifically, only one pebble can access a node at a time. The goal of PMOG is to determine whether a
					target configuration is reachable from the initial arrangement of pebbles and provide the sequence of
					required moves if it is.</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-8 col-12-medium">
						<p><strong>Concretely</strong>, PMOG is applicable in robotic warehousing systems: the pebbles represent
							robots that access physical locations. This example is not as far fetched as it sounds: thousands of
							robots are delivering packages from storage to packing stations in warehouses every day and Kiva Systems
							is the company that pioneered their use. It’s also not new: Staples was the first company to go live with
							a Kiva system in 2006! A 2016 report estimated that Amazon was operating ~30k units. The image below shows
							the layout of a typical robotic distribution center.</p>
						<p>Robots pick up and deliver shelves of inventory to pick/pack workers in the Kiva system as shown below. 
							See the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/2908675.2908681">image source</a> for more information.

				<p>PMOG generalizes and solves a fundamental problem. However, the constraints could be relaxed for this
					application: robots only need to <strong>visit</strong> destination nodes, they don’t need to be in a
					pre-defined end configuration at the same time. <strong>Hence the ‘visiting’ part of the title.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>This relaxation has implications for the feasibility check of the original PMOG: it’s easy to come up
					with feasible visiting PMOG cases that are infeasible in PMOG. Since warehouses are rectangular
					workspaces, my work is restricted to graphs made up of <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconnected_graph">bi-connected</a> rectangular grids. As long as
					there is at least one open node and the graph is bi-connected, every destination assignment is feasible in
					<strong>Visiting Pebble Motion on Rectangual Grids.</strong></p>

						<p>Let robots find their way using something like <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A*</a>, if another robot gets in the way,
							simply wait until the node is free again. Using the <a
								href="https://research.csc.ncsu.edu/alphabetsoup/">Alphabet Soup</a> multi-robot simulator, I modified
							the default behaviour to strictly adhere to the underlying navigation graph. Then, I only allowed robots
							to enter a node if it is empty. The snapshot below shows what it looked like: the robots are pink,
							replenishing stations are blue, shelves are purple and packing stations are green. The shelves contain
							letters and the parcels being packed are words from a dictionary.</p>

				<p>There is a problem though: eventually the robots get stuck waiting

						<p>Let’s focus on a single robot that is stuck and assume it can order others to move out of its way. A <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">Breadth First Search</a> (BFS) for the first
							open node reveals the shortest path of moves to clear the blocked node (i.e the ‘swap path’). The process
							is shown below. In some cases, robots start in their target positions, or reach them by moving out of the
							way for others, this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serendipity">fortunate accident</a>.</p>

						<p>The video below shows a simulator written in Java to develop the deadlock resolution strategy. Square
							brackets represent grid positions and numbers represent robots. Each node is the target of the robot with

							matter. As expected, all robots eventually end up in ‘Completed’.</p>

						<p>Simultaneous motion is achieved by assigning a priority to each robot and defining a round consisting of
							two phases. In a first phase, robots instruct each other to move along the swap path determined using BFS.
							A robot sends instructions either to itself or the robot at the tip of the swap path. Robots send
							instructions to themselves in two scenarios: 1) to move to the next node, and 2) to remain in place while
							ordering others to move. This ensures that high priority robots decrease their distance from their target
							monotonically, which in turn ensures that progress is being made. Idle robots don’t send instructions, but
							receive them. At the end of this phase, each robot selects the highest priority instruction and forwards
							it as a node access request, maintaining the original sender’s priority.</p>
						<p>In the second phase, <strong>nodes</strong> select the highest priority request to notify successful
							requesters and these robots move. Then, all robots empty their instruction queues. This ends the round and
							the process repeats until all tasks are complete, at which point no one sends instructions and everything
							stops.</p>
						<p>In the video below, the same task assignments are used as before. Lower numbers mean higher priorities,
							making life hard for robot 10!</p>

					synchronous assumption.</h1>

				<p>So far actions were synchronized into rounds and robots/nodes knew when the transitions occur. However, the
					real world is asynchronous and these timings aren’t known beforehand. Unavoidable variances mean that some
					robots are faster than others and it is wasteful to synchronize node transitions into fixed time slices. But,
					without a centralized synchronization signal, robots don’t know when to replan and nodes don’t know when to
					grant access.</p>
				<p>The answer to reducing this waste is to notify robots when their instructions have failed. Nodes notify all
					requesters when access is granted, and requesters react accordingly. Failed requests are relayed by the
					requesters to their originators. Instructed robots don’t know whether their instruction queues already contain
					the highest priority instruction they will get, so they immediately request what they have, and update
					accordingly when new requests arrive by withdrawing/resubmitting requests.</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-8 col-12-medium">
						<p>Getting the programming right is <strong>really difficult</strong>. Instead of wading through the gory
							details, let’s see it in action! The grid in the video below has tasks assigned in row major order. Robots
							indicate completion by highlighting themselves in red and indicate node visits by marking them with a
							purple circle. These robots have randomly initialized acceleration and speed limits to simulate real-world
							variances.</p>
						<p>Note that any task assignment is allowed. In fact, robots can even all have the same target node as shown
							below. In fact, this is an example of an infeasible PMOG assignment.</p>

						<p>So far only single tasks were assigned. Multiple tasks can be assigned by setting the robot’s priority
							equal to the task number. Even if one task is delayed by many others, as overriding tasks complete, the
							blocked task’s priority effectively raises until it overrides every other robot. The video below shows
							robots cyclically completing multiple random node visits.</p>

						<p>Using the random cyclic task assignments, the figure below shows the number of completed missions versus

							experiments for grids with different aspect ratios.</p>
						<p>The maximum number of completed tasks always occurs for around 30 robots independent of the grid aspect
							ratio. The simulations were run headless and no deadlocks or collisions occurred, that’s 1001 flawless

				<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
				<p>The relaxations on PMOG allows robots to deliver payloads without collisions or deadlocks, in continuous
					asynchronous time and require comparatively little computation. These were the extents of my research scope
					and there is much room for improvement in terms of optimality. However, I am proud of what I achieved and am
					glad to have made a contribution to robotics research, however big or small.</p>
